        Hi! I intend to use this blog to document my spiritual journey and
        growth. I intend to do in depth, but also not too boring, blog posts on
        my learnings and takeaways from every book and chapter of the Bible. I
        plan on starting in the New Testament first, from Matthew to Revelation.
        Then, I want to move on to the Old Testament. But first, a little about
        me. I first gained the Lord at the age of 8, when a lyric from a hymnal
        brought me to tears. The lyric went: Lord, take my life, I present it to
        You! If I had a thousand, I'd pour all on You! Nothing withholding, my
        all is for You. My life and my future, dear Lord, is all for You. Of
        course, at the age of 8, I didn't have a full realization of what these
        words would really mean. It wasn't until years later that I would
        understand the true cost, the value, and the weight of these words. All
        I knew then was that tears were falling down my face. I knew, at the age
        of 8, that I felt something real. I got baptized in 2019, on the same
        day as my birthday. I chose that specific date, my birthday, to
        commemorate both my human birth and spiritual re- birth. Since then,
        I've had many ups and downs in my Christian life. I want to use this
        blog as my own documentation of where I am, and hopefully you may gain
        something too. I don't yet know how often I will post: hopefully as much
        as possible with time permitting. I truly hope that this blog encourages
        me to stay in the Word of God. Oh! I almost forgot. As to the name of
        the blog, "But you, Beloved" comes from Jude 1:20. The Lord has recently
        put the writings of Jude in my heart, and I've been musing on it for the
        past few weeks or so. I just thought it sounded fitting for a blog name,
        and I hope you can agree!
